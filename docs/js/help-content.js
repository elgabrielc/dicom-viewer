When you receive imaging studies from a hospital or imaging center, the files are typically in a format called DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). This is the universal standard format that all medical imaging equipment uses worldwide.</p>\n<p>With this viewer, you can:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>View your own medical images</strong> directly in your web browser</li><li><strong>Scroll through image &quot;slices&quot;</strong> that make up a 3D scan of your body</li><li><strong>Adjust brightness and contrast</strong> to see different tissues more clearly</li><li><strong>Zoom in</strong> on areas of interest</li><li><strong>Keep your images private</strong> - everything runs in your browser; nothing is uploaded anywhere</li></ul>\n<h3>About DICOM Files</h3>\n<p>When you have a CT or MRI scan, the machine captures many individual images called &quot;slices&quot; - think of them like slices of bread in a loaf. Together, these slices create a complete picture of the scanned area of your body. A typical CT scan might contain anywhere from 50 to over 500 individual slices.</p>\n<p>DICOM files contain not just the image data but also information about the scan itself: when it was taken, what type of scan it was, the patient name, and technical details that help the viewer display the image correctly.</p>\n<p>Your images might be delivered to you on a CD, downloaded from a patient portal, or shared through a secure link. They&#39;re typically organized in folders, with one folder per study.</p>"

Think of it like adjusting the &quot;window&quot; through which you view the data:</p>\n<ul><li>The <strong>Center</strong> (or Level) determines which brightness value sits in the middle of what you see</li><li>The <strong>Width</strong> (or Window) determines how wide a range of values are visible</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p>\n<p>With the W/L tool selected (it&#39;s selected by default), click and drag on the image:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Drag Direction</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Left/Right</strong></td><td>Adjusts contrast (Window Width) - drag right for more contrast</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Up/Down</strong></td><td>Adjusts brightness (Window Center) - drag up to make the image darker</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The current values are shown in the toolbar (e.g., <code>C: 40  W: 400</code>).</p>\n<p><strong>Practical example:</strong></p>\n<p>On a CT scan, different Window/Level settings reveal different structures:</p>\n<ul><li>A narrow window makes subtle differences in soft tissue visible</li><li>A wide window shows bones clearly but soft tissue looks flat</li></ul>\n<h3>Pan</h3>\n<p>Moves the image around in the viewing area.

The brightness values in an MRI aren&#39;t standardized the way CT values are. They depend on the specific scanner, the settings used, and the type of scan.</p>\n<p>Because of this, the viewer calculates appropriate brightness/contrast settings automatically based on the actual pixel values in your images.

This cache grows as you navigate through a series.</li><li><strong>Very large studies</strong> (thousands of slices or multiple large series loaded simultaneously) may cause your browser to slow down or display memory warnings.</li></ul>\n<h3>Recommendations for Optimal Performance</h3>\n<ol><li><strong>Close unused browser tabs</strong> before loading very large studies to free up memory.</li><li><strong>Load one study at a time</strong> rather than dropping multiple large study folders simultaneously.</li><li><strong>Use Chrome or Edge</strong> as recommended; these browsers tend to handle large amounts of image data more efficiently.</li><li><strong>If the viewer becomes sluggish</strong>, refresh the page to clear memory, then reload only the study you need to view.</li><li><strong>For extremely large datasets</strong> (whole-body CT with thousands of slices), consider using dedicated medical imaging software on your computer, which has better memory management for such cases.</li></ol>\n<h3>File System Access</h3>\n<p>The viewer uses your browser&#39;s File System Access API to read DICOM files directly from your computer. This means:</p>\n<ul><li>Files are read on-demand as you navigate, rather than all being loaded upfront</li><li>No files are uploaded to any server</li><li>Performance depends partly on your storage speed (SSD is faster than traditional hard drives)</li></ul>"
